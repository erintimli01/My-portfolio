  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am 32 years old and I recently moved to Maryland after living in Delaware my whole life. For 16 years, I worked
    in retail pharmacy and I really enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of that. That led me to wonder what else I could
    do with that interest and it led me to coding!</p>
  <ul class="about-me">
    <li>I am a student enrolled at Epicodus</li>
    <li>I love music of all types, especially which has a funky bass line</li>
    <li>I really enjoy photography and am a collector of old cameras</li>
    <li>I am a dog mom to a sweet, pitbull mix named Natty</li>
  </ul>
